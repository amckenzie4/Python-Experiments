Python-Experiments
==================

Small function modules and experimental stuff.


Included files and modules:

1) print_r.py
  This module allows the use of a command very similar to PHP's print_r().  It returns a readably
  formatted view of the contents of a string, number, list, tuple, or dict.  It handles nested arrays
  reasonably gracefully.
